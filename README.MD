## Credential Saver BOT
- supports set/get/del commands
- works with couchDB
- printed creds are deleted after 30 seconds

### Not handled problems yet:
- supporting more than one user, which can use bot simultaneously
- deprecated updates should be changed by webhooks
- in case of changing commands' list, need to change twice in the code
